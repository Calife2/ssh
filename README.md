# ssh
SSH is widely used in system administration, software development, and other fields where secure remote access and communication are essential. It has largely replaced older, less secure protocols like Telnet and FTP.
SSH is commonly used for remote shell access, allowing users to log in and execute commands on a remote machine as if they were physically present at the console. It can also be used for secure file transfer and tunneling network traffic.
